Boeing Co (BA) plunged over -7% and was the top percentage loser on the Dow and S&P 500 after Wells Fargo Securities downgraded the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing an increased risk that the heightened scrutiny of the company’s manufacturing quality could affect the pace of production or deliveries. Also, Morgan Stanley (MS) slumped more than -4% after the bank reported mixed Q4 results and warned of lower margins in the wealth-management business. In addition, Spirit Airlines Inc (SAVE) plummeted over -47% after a federal judge blocked the company’s planned $3.8 billion sale to JetBlue Airways on antitrust grounds. On the bullish side, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) soared more than +8% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after Susquehanna Financial raised its price target on the stock to $170 from $130.

All European sectors were in the red, with real estate and retailers leading the declines. Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed on Wednesday that Britain’s annual consumer price inflation rate unexpectedly accelerated in December, driven by new taxes on tobacco products. Separately, data showed Wednesday that Eurozone headline inflation increased to +2.9% y/y in December from +2.4% y/y in November, confirming preliminary estimates. Meanwhile, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated on Wednesday that the central bank is making progress in returning inflation to its 2% target, although victory has not yet been won. Also, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot mentioned that markets are premature in pricing monetary easing. In corporate news, Telecom Italia Spa/Milano (TIT.M.DX) rose about +1% following the approval by the Italian government for the sale of its fixed-line network to the U.S. fund KKR.\n","U.K.’s CPI, U.K.’s Core CPI, Eurozone’s CPI, and Eurozone’s Core CPI data were released today.\n","U.K. December CPI has been reported at +0.4% m/m and +4.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.8% y/y.\n","U.K. December Core CPI stood at +0.6% m/m and +5.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.4% m/m and +4.9% y/y.\n","Eurozone December CPI came in at +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y, in line with expectations.\n","Eurozone December Core CPI arrived at +0.5% m/m and +3.4% y/y, compared to expectations of +0.4% m/m and +3.4% y/y.\n","Asian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -2.09% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.40%.\n","China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed sharply lower today as a slew of disappointing economic data reignited concerns about the pace of the economic recovery. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed on Wednesday that China’s economy expanded by +5.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, slightly falling short of economists’ expectations. However, China’s annual GDP growth rate of +5.2% matched the rate that economists had expected, surpassing Beijing’s official target of “around 5%.” At the same time, the latest figures for December continued to exacerbate concerns regarding the growth outlook. China’s new-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, fell the most in almost nine years in December, while retail sales growth slowed and investment remained tepid. Only industrial output exhibited some signs of improvement. Meanwhile, risk appetite was further dampened by President Xi Jinping’s vow to establish a financial system that “inherently differs” from the Western model, along with his calls for financial regulators to possess “long teeth and thorns.” In other news, foreign investors offloaded about 13 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) worth of Chinese stocks on a net basis on Wednesday, the most in over a year.

Utilities and healthcare stocks led the declines on Wednesday. The stock benchmark initially moved higher as a weaker yen boosted export-oriented stocks, while chip-related stocks mirrored the overnight gains of U.S. peers. However, the Nikkei experienced a sharp decline mid-morning in Tokyo as investors chose to secure some profits. Meanwhile, Japanese government bond yields rose on Wednesday as caution over an upcoming 20-year bond auction in the next session led investors to sell bonds. In corporate news, Fujitsu Ltd plunged about -4% following statements from its European director to British lawmakers on Tuesday, asserting that the company holds a “moral obligation” to compensate victims of a scandal in which its defective software resulted in false accusations of embezzlement against British post office staff.

holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF (Symbol: IVOV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $92.34 per unit.\n","With IVOV trading at a recent price near $84.24 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.61% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IVOV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Black Hills Corporation (Symbol: BKH), Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), and Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (Symbol: SWX). Although BKH has traded at a recent price of $51.58/share, the average analyst target is 16.00% higher at $59.83/share. Similarly, AA has 15.00% upside from the recent share price of $27.87 if the average analyst target price of $32.05/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SWX to reach a target price of $69.67/share, which is 14.58% above the recent price of $60.80. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BKH, AA, and SWX:\n","Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n","NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG.

SWX $60.80 $69.67 14.58%\n","Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.\n","10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »\n","Also see:\n"," Institutional Holders of HY\n"," TMAC Insider Buying\n"," Funds Holding LCUT\n","The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n","Named Entities: [('ETF Channel', 'ORG'), ('12-month', 'DATE'), ('ETF', 'ORG'), ('400', 'CARDINAL'), ('Value', 'ORG'), ('ETF', 'ORG'), ('92.34', 'MONEY'), ('84.24', 'MONEY'), ('9.61%', 'PERCENT'), ('Three', 'CARDINAL'), ('IVOV', 'ORG'), ('Black Hills Corporation', 'ORG'), ('Alcoa Corporation', 'ORG'), ('Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.', 'ORG'), ('BKH', 'ORG'), ('51.58', 'MONEY'), ('16.00%', 'PERCENT'), ('59.83', 'MONEY'), ('15.00%', 'PERCENT'), ('27.87', 'MONEY'), ('32.05', 'MONEY'), ('69.67', 'MONEY'), ('14.58%', 'PERCENT'), ('60.80', 'MONEY'), ('twelve month', 'DATE'), ('BKH', 'ORG'), ('AVG', 'ORG'), ('12-MO', 'DATE'), ('TARGET', 'PERSON'), ('Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap', 'PERSON'), ('400', 'CARDINAL'), ('$84.24 $92.34', 'MONEY'), ('9.61%', 'PERCENT'), ('Black Hills Corporation', 'ORG'), ('$51.58 $', 'MONEY'), ('59.83', 'MONEY'), ('16.00%', 'PERCENT'), ('Alcoa Corporation AA', 'ORG'), ('$27.87 $', 'MONEY'), ('32.05', 'MONEY'), ('15.00%', 'PERCENT'), ('Southwest Gas Holdings', 'ORG'), ('$60.80 $', 'MONEY'), ('69.67', 'MONEY'), ('14.58%', 'PERCENT'), ('12 months from now', 'DATE'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Institutional Holders of HY', 'ORG'), ('Nasdaq, Inc.', 'ORG')]\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Text: March S&P 500 E-Mini futures (ESH24) are trending down -0.33% this morning as investors digested weak economic data from China while also gearing up for crucial U.S. retail sales data.\n","In Tuesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major averages closed in the red, with the blue-chip Dow falling to a 3-1/2 week low. Boeing Co (BA) plunged over -7% and was the top percentage loser on the Dow and S&P 500 after Wells Fargo Securities downgraded the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing an increased risk that the heightened scrutiny of the company’s manufacturing quality could affect the pace of production or deliveries. Also, Morgan Stanley (MS) slumped more than -4% after the bank reported mixed Q4 results and warned of lower margins in the wealth-management business.

Economists, on average, forecast that December Retail Sales will stand at +0.4% m/m, compared to the previous value of +0.3% m/m.\n","Also, investors will likely focus on U.S. Core Retail Sales data, which came in at +0.2% m/m in November.

All European sectors were in the red, with real estate and retailers leading the declines. Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed on Wednesday that Britain’s annual consumer price inflation rate unexpectedly accelerated in December, driven by new taxes on tobacco products. Separately, data showed Wednesday that Eurozone headline inflation increased to +2.9% y/y in December from +2.4% y/y in November, confirming preliminary estimates. Meanwhile, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated on Wednesday that the central bank is making progress in returning inflation to its 2% target, although victory has not yet been won. Also, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot mentioned that markets are premature in pricing monetary easing. In corporate news, Telecom Italia Spa/Milano (TIT.M.DX) rose about +1% following the approval by the Italian government for the sale of its fixed-line network to the U.S. fund KKR.\n","U.K.’s CPI, U.K.’s Core CPI, Eurozone’s CPI, and Eurozone’s Core CPI data were released today.\n","U.K. December CPI has been reported at +0.4% m/m and +4.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.8% y/y.\n","U.K. December Core CPI stood at +0.6% m/m and +5.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.4% m/m and +4.9% y/y.\n","Eurozone December CPI came in at +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y, in line with expectations.\n","Eurozone December Core CPI arrived at +0.5% m/m and +3.4% y/y, compared to expectations of +0.4% m/m and +3.4% y/y.\n","Asian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -2.09% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.40%.\n","China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed sharply lower today as a slew of disappointing economic data reignited concerns about the pace of the economic recovery. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed on Wednesday that China’s economy expanded by +5.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, slightly falling short of economists’ expectations. However, China’s annual GDP growth rate of +5.2% matched the rate that economists had expected, surpassing Beijing’s official target of “around 5%.” At the same time, the latest figures for December continued to exacerbate concerns regarding the growth outlook. China’s new-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, fell the most in almost nine years in December, while retail sales growth slowed and investment remained tepid. Only industrial output exhibited some signs of improvement. Meanwhile, risk appetite was further dampened by President Xi Jinping’s vow to establish a financial system that “inherently differs” from the Western model, along with his calls for financial regulators to possess “long teeth and thorns.” In other news, foreign investors offloaded about 13 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) worth of Chinese stocks on a net basis on Wednesday, the most in over a year.

Utilities and healthcare stocks led the declines on Wednesday. The stock benchmark initially moved higher as a weaker yen boosted export-oriented stocks, while chip-related stocks mirrored the overnight gains of U.S. peers. However, the Nikkei experienced a sharp decline mid-morning in Tokyo as investors chose to secure some profits. Meanwhile, Japanese government bond yields rose on Wednesday as caution over an upcoming 20-year bond auction in the next session led investors to sell bonds. In corporate news, Fujitsu Ltd plunged about -4% following statements from its European director to British lawmakers on Tuesday, asserting that the company holds a “moral obligation” to compensate victims of a scandal in which its defective software resulted in false accusations of embezzlement against British post office staff.
